# The Challenge:

You are a team of scouts at Ironhack FC. You have been tasked with examining the attached dataset to understand which attributes are the best predictors of a football player's potential so that the club can sign future stars. Because the Chairman of Ironhack FC is a busy person, they have requested that you provide your findings in a short 5 minute presentation. The Chairman doesn't understand anything about coding, so has requested that there is no code shown in the presentation. Finally, the Chairman has asked you to provide the top three players that your model recommends signing under a budget of $100M. 

## Objectives:
Ask interesting and thoughtful questions and find the data to answer them.
Apply the statistical techniques we have learned.
Create multiple models and compare them, so that you can convince the Chairman that your final model is the best. 
Create useful and clear graphs.
